General instructions
====================

Use in-band registration to register to a gateway component.
For instance, in gajim, go to the menu "accountsâ†’service discovery", choose
the gateway and click register.

You will then have to fill a form with your credentials.
Once this is done, you'll receive a contact request from the gateway component
(for instance signal.slidge.im); you must accept it to complete the registration.
