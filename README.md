Turn any XMPP client into that fancy multiprotocol chat app that every cool kid want.

Slidge is a general purpose XMPP (puppeteer) gateway framework in python.
It's a work in progress, but it should make
[writing gateways to other chat networks](https://slidge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/tutorial.html)
(*plugins*) as frictionless as possible.

It comes with a few plugins included.

|            | Direct messages | Presences | Typing | Marks | Upload | Correction |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| Signal     | âœ“               | N/A       | âœ“      | âœ“     | âœ“      | N/A        |
| Telegram   | âœ“               | ~         | âœ“      | âœ“     | âœ“      | âœ“          |
| Mattermost | âœ“               | âœ“         | âœ—      | âœ—     | âœ—      | âœ—          |
| Facebook   | âœ“               | âœ—         | âœ“      | âœ“     | âœ“      | âœ“          |
| Skype      | âœ“               | âœ—         | âœ—      | âœ—     | ~      | âœ—          |

(this table may not be entirely accurate, but **in theory**, stuff marked âœ“ works)


Status
------

Slidge is alpha-grade software.
Right now, only direct messages are implemented, no group chat stuff at all.
Direct messaging does (more or less) work though.
Any contribution whatsoever (testing, patches, suggestions, beer, â€¦) is more than welcome.
Don't be shy!

Testing locally should be fairly easy, so please go ahead and give me some
feedback, through the [MUC](xmpp:slidge@conference.nicoco.fr?join), the
[issue tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~nicoco/slidge) or in my
[public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~nicoco/public-inbox).

Installation
------------

#### docker-compose

Docker-compose spins up a local XMPP server preconfigured for you. 

```
docker-compose up # or poetry install && poetry run `python -m slidge`
```

For the other options, you need a
[configured](https://slidge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/general.html#configure-the-xmpp-server)
XMPP server.

#### poetry

```
poetry install
poetry run python -m slidge
```

#### pip

```bash
pip install slidge[signal]  # you can replace signal with any network listed in the table above
python -m slidge --legacy-module=slidge.plugins.signal
```

### XMPP client

Open [gajim](https://gajim.org) (or another XMPP client),
and add your account (``test@localhost`` / ``password`` if you use the server provided with docker-compose).
Go to "Accounts"â†’"Discover services" (or equivalent).
You should see the slidge gateways as server components.

About privacy
-------------

Slidge (and most if not all XMPP gateway that I know of) will break
end-to-end encryption, or more precisely one of the 'ends' become the
gateway itself. If privacy is a major concern for you, my advice would
be to:

-   use XMPP + OMEMO
-   self-host your gateways
-   have your gateways hosted by someone you know AFK and trust
